Document 1: Product Requirements Document (PRD)
1. Project Goal
To create a secure, middle-man platform that holds funds (Bank or Crypto) until both parties in a transaction are satisfied with the delivery of goods or services.
2. User Roles
* Initiator (Sender): The user who starts the deal and invites the second party.
* Recipient (Receiver): The user who receives the invitation and performs the service/provides the product.
* Admin: A backend role to resolve disputes.
3. Core Functional Requirements
A. The Invitation System ("Obviate Link")
* User enters an email address to invite a counterparty.
* The system generates a unique, signed URL.
* If the recipient doesn't have an account, the link directs them to a "claim account" page.
* Upon signup, the deal is automatically linked to their new profile.
B. The Escrow Lifecycle
The platform must track the following states:
1. Draft: Deal created but invite not accepted.
2. Active: Both parties have joined.
3. Funding: Waiting for the Initiator to deposit funds.
4. Funded: Funds are confirmed (via Bank receipt or Blockchain tx).
5. In Review: Recipient marks the task as complete.
6. Completed: Initiator releases funds; platform takes a fee.
7. Disputed: Either party freezes the transaction for Admin review.
C. Payment Methods
* Bank Transfer: Manual upload of transfer receipts or automated via Plaid/Stripe.
* Crypto: Support for stablecoins (USDC/USDT) to avoid volatility during the escrow period.
4. High-Level Feature List
* Dashboard: View active, pending, and completed deals.
* Deal Room: A private page for each escrow with a status stepper and a simple chat/activity log.
* Wallet/Payout: A section for users to add their withdrawal bank details or wallet addresses.
